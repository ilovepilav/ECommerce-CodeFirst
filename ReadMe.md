In this repository I created an **E-Commerce** database with **Code First Approach** using **.NET Core 5.0.1**. The Database's schematic is below. I will continue to build this project *'root to fruit'* with implementing new technologies, different programming languages etc.

# .NET Core

.NET (previously named [.NET Core](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.NET_Core)) is a free and open-source, managed computer software framework for Windows, Linux, and macOS operating systems. It is a cross-platform successor to .NET Framework. The project is primarily developed by Microsoft employees by way of the .NET Foundation, and released under the MIT License.
# Code First Approach
[Code First](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/entity_framework/entity_framework_code_first_approach.htm) modeling workflow targets a database that doesn't exist and Code First will create it. It can also be used if you have an empty database and then Code First will add new tables to it. Code First allows you to define your model using C# or VB.Net classes.
